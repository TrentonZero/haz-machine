A Z-Machine implementation in Haskell. 

Still in progress. Early, early stages and not even close to fulfilling all of
the Z-Machine spec, available
[here](http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/index.html).

So far, I think I have everything around the memory state configured and
functions needed to modify it appropriately written. So looks like it's time to
start implementing the op codes. 

I have some TDD scaffolding to give me some confidence as I move forward, and
every method has at least one or two test cases around. Not perfect coverage by
any means. 

What is so frightening about the fact that, three years in a row, I have restarted interest in this
project in February?
